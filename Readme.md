## How to use

`npm install paga-business`

 
```
const PagaBusinessClient = require('paga-business')

var pagaBusinessClient = PagaBusinessClient.Builder()
                            .setPrincipal("<publicId>")
                            .setCredential("<password>")
                            .setApiKey("<apiKey>")
                            .setIsTest(true)
                            .build();
```

As shown above, you set the principal and credential given to you by Paga, If you pass true as the value for setIsTest(), the library will use the test url as the base for all calls. Otherwise setting it to false will use the live url value you **pass** as the base.
