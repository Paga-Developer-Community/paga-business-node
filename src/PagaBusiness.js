     * @param   {string}  destinationAccount            The account identifier for the recipient receiving the money transfer. This account identifier may be a phone number, account nickname, or any other unique account identifier supported by the Paga platform. If destinationBank is specified, this is the bank account number.

     * @param   {boolean} sendWithdrawalCode            If the cash is being sent on behalf of the third party itself (i.e. sender principal is null), then this indicates whether confirmation messages for funds sent to non Paga customers will include the withdrawal code in the message (true) or omit it (false). If false, then the withdrawal code will be returned in the withdrawalCode response parameter. For funds sent to Paga customers, the funds are deposited directly into the customer's account so no withdrawal code is necessary. Defaults to true.
     * @param   {string}  sourceOfFunds                 The name of a source account for funds. If null, the source sender's Paga account will be used as the funding source.
     * @param   {string}  transferReference             Additional transfer-specific reference information that may be required for transfer processing.
     * @param   {boolean} suppressRecipientMessage      Whether to prevent sending an SMS to the recipient of the money transfer. This can be used in cases where the business wishes to perform their own messaging. Defaults to false, meaning that messages are NOT suppressed.
     * @param   {string}  locale                        The language/locale to be used in messaging. If provided, this must conform to the IETF language tag standard.
     * @param   {string}  alternateSenderName           If the cash is being sent on behalf of the third party itself (i.e. sender principal is null), then an alternative name-of-sender can be specified here for use in the message sent to the money transfer recipient. This field is ignored if money transfer is sent on behalf of another user. This can be 16 characters in length.
     * @param   {number}  holdingPeriod                 The number of days with which the recipient's KYC must have before it is reverted back to the sender. It is only valid if the minKYCLevel is set and it's default to 120 days. If minKYCLevel is set and the recipient?s KYC is below it, then this will be the number of days it should wait to meet the minKYC Level provided. If the target KYC is not upgraded within this period the fund will be returned back to the sender?s account.
     * @param   {string}  minRecipientKYCLevel         The minimum target KYC level the money transfer transaction recipient's paga account must have, can be one of KYC1, KYC2, and KYC3.
